# Parkinsons-Disease-Detector  

The goal of this project is to employ a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the detection of Parkinson’s disease. Key libraries utilized include Numpy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.  

## Data Refinement:

Data preprocessing involved several steps to enhance data quality. These steps encompassed managing invalid values, filtering out non-numeric entries, converting non-numeric columns, handling missing values, and appropriately truncating values.  

## Feature Transformation:  

Categorical attributes were effectively encoded using OneHotEncoder, contributing to improved learning efficiency. Additionally, a comprehensive pipeline for Logistic Regression was constructed to streamline the process. Model persistence was ensured through the utilization of the Pickle library.  

## Results and Model Assessment:  

Model assessment was carried out using the R-squared metric, resulting in an achievement of 84.9%. This demonstrates the model’s capacity to accurately predict car prices.  

In summary, this project successfully utilizes SVM for Parkinson’s disease detection. The data preparation, feature transformation, and evaluation process ensure reliable outcomes.
